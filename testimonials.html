	      		<p>“As a client of Marcus &amp; Boxerman for over 25 years, I can honestly and very happily proclaim that the firm’s attorneys possess the unique combination of elegant and intelligent legal minds, profound work ethic, and a single-minded commitment to success. Marcus &amp; Boxerman has served as my companies’ general counsel, representing my franchise systems in all litigation, arbitration and transactional matters. The work of Marcus &amp; Boxerman never fails to remind me how blessed I am to have walked into their office so many years ago.”</p>

	      		<p>“Once we decided to proceed with obtaining the franchise Michael was terrific. ... He made himself available whenever we needed him to get the deal done. At one crucial time right before we were heading to London a deal breaking issue had to be resolved. Michael took hours one weekend, while on a family vacation, to get on a conference call and resolve the matter. I have been in business for over forty years and this kind of dedication is rare. .. Michael went above and beyond our expectations in getting our deal done within parameters acceptable to us. .. I would recommend Michael Boxerman to anyone needing legal representation regarding franchises without any reservations.”</p>

	      		<p>“My wife and I own a small business. We recently had to re-negotiate our lease. Our landlord is a decent guy, but our embarking on a 10-year commitment for our business can be daunting. There can be a lot of what-if's. In choosing Michael Boxerman of Marcus & Boxerman to review our lease, we found someone with a track record who has seen some of the unexpected issues that can happen to a business. Lease issues that can affect our future ability to sell our business, protections related to our use of our space, asking (and receiving!) help from our landlord concerning space buildout -- these are areas that Michael identified and guided us through in our negotiations. Integrity and an attitude of fairness are qualities that have kept us with Marcus & Boxerman. Two thumbs up for this firm.”</p>

Given the urgency to close on the sale of our dental practice by year-end, Michael was extremely responsive and worked with us well outside of normal business hours and throughout the holiday season. Thanks to Michael’s assistance, the transaction closed smoothly. Michael’s no-nonsense approach fit us perfectly. We recommend Michael and Marcus & Boxerman without reservation.

We were stuck in a pretty bad situation; not only was he able to draft all the paperwork for the sale, but also he was an efficient mediator between both parties.  Many issues came up while closing the deal, Boxerman was able to convince the other party so most issues settled in our favor.  He was very patient, attentive to detail and concise with his work.

After knocking on several doors, we found them on Google with excellent reviews on the issue of FRANCHISING which pertained to our situation. We are a small family business with few years in the market as well as simple people with limited resources. We met Mike and his team, they treated us with frankness, respect and all the professionalism we expected. They were direct, they asked us clearly what we hoped to achieve and they drew up the strategy to help us achieve that goal. The excellent work of this team restored our peace of mind and hope. Everything was solved much sooner than expected and exactly the way we wanted it. They were transparent and adequate regarding their fees and we were 100% pleased. Thanks to all your team. THEY SURPASSED ALL OUR EXPECTATIONS. WE RECOMMEND THEM TO EVERYONE!</span></span></span>”</p>

We began working together with our first restaurant and they have helped us grow into 4 locations, with more on the way. Aside from their extensive knowledge and expertise in working with restaurants/franchises, their ability to breakdown common law jargon into understandable phrases to allow us to make critical decisions, has really made working with them a pleasure. </p>
				<p>Michael Boxerman and his team's willingness to help and work beyond expectation, has always put our minds at ease, knowing that we are in the best hands possible. They have always made themselves available when we needed them and more importantly, they have been trustworthy and fair.
